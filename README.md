# IBM-SMARTPARKING
Example output of IoT device data transmission:

1. Parking Spot Occupancy: "Spot 1: Occupied" - This message is sent from the IoT device installed in Spot 1 of a parking garage, indicating that the spot is currently occupied by a vehicle.

2. Parking Spot Availability: "Spot 5: Available" - This message is sent from the IoT device installed in Spot 5, indicating that the spot is currently empty and available for parking.

3. Parking Lot Capacity: "Capacity: 50/100" - This message is sent from the IoT device installed at the entrance of a parking lot, providing real-time information about the total capacity of the lot and the number of occupied spots.

Example output of the platform UI for smart parking:

1. Visualization of Parking Lot Layout: The platform UI displays a map or a graphical representation of the parking lot, highlighting the occupied and available parking spots. The user can easily identify the status of each spot at a glance.

2. Real-time Updates: The platform UI continuously updates the status of parking spots in real-time, indicating when a spot becomes occupied or available. This allows users to quickly find an available spot without wasting time searching.

3. Reservation System: The platform UI offers a reservation system, where users can see which spots are available for reservation and reserve a spot in advance. The UI displays the reserved spots, ensuring that they are reserved exclusively for the designated user.

4. Notifications: The platform UI sends notifications to users, informing them about the availability of parking spots within their preferred location or their reserved spot becoming occupied. This helps users make informed decisions and minimizes the time spent searching for parking.

5. Historical Data and Analytics: The platform UI stores historical data related to parking occupancy, allowing users to analyze trends, peak usage hours, and optimize parking capacity. This data can be presented through charts, graphs, or statistical summaries in the UI, aiding parking management decisions.

Here are the instructions to replicate the smart parking project, set up IoT devices, develop the data-sharing platform, and integrate them using Python:

1. Hardware Setup:
   - Acquire the necessary hardware components such as Raspberry Pi, distance sensors, LEDs, and cameras.
   - Connect the sensors and LEDs to the Raspberry Pi as per the manufacturer's instructions.
   - Mount the sensors in the desired locations in your parking area.

2. IoT Device Setup:
   - Install the operating system on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS).
   - Connect the Raspberry Pi to the internet (either via Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
   - Install the necessary software libraries for sensor communication (e.g., RPi.GPIO for GPIO access).
   - Write a Python program to read data from the distance sensors and control the LEDs based on the availability of parking spots.
   - Test and verify the program's functionality on the Raspberry Pi.

3. Data-Sharing Platform Development:
   - Choose a suitable platform for data sharing and storage, e.g., Google Cloud IoT Core, AWS IoT, or your own server.
   - Set up an account and create a project on the chosen platform.
   - Configure the platform to receive and store data from the IoT devices (e.g., define data schemas or topics).
   - Generate the necessary credentials and access tokens to authenticate the IoT devices with the platform.
   - Develop a Python program to send data from the Raspberry Pi to the data-sharing platform using the platform's APIs or SDKs.
   - Test the data ingestion functionality by sending simulated data or actual sensor data to the platform.

4. Integration using Python:
   - Install the required Python packages for integration, such as `paho-mqtt` for MQTT communication or `requests` for REST APIs.
   - Modify the existing Python program running on the Raspberry Pi to integrate with the data-sharing platform.
   - Use the platform's provided libraries or APIs to establish a connection to the platform and authenticate the device.
   - Modify the program to send sensor data to the data-sharing platform periodically or when there is a change in parking spot availability.
   - Implement functionality to receive commands from the platform and control the LEDs accordingly.

5. Deployment and Testing:
   - Deploy the modified Python program on the Raspberry Pi.
   - Mount the Raspberry Pi and connect the sensors in the actual parking area.
   - Validate the functionality by observing the LEDs' behavior based on the parking spot availability.
   - Monitor the data-sharing platform to ensure sensor data is being received correctly and displayed accurately.
   - Perform thorough testing to verify the overall system's reliability and performance.
   - Make any necessary adjustments or enhancements to improve the system.

By following these instructions, you should be able to replicate the project, set up IoT devices for smart parking, develop the data-sharing platform, and integrate them using Python.
